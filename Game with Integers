/* problem description
Vanya and Vova are playing a game. Players are given an integer n.
On their turn, the player can add 1 to the current integer or subtract 1.
The players take turns; Vanya starts. If after Vanya's move the integer is divisible by 3, then he wins.
If 10 moves have passed and Vanya has not won, then Vova wins.

Write a program that, based on the integer n, determines who will win if both players play optimally.

// Solution

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
 
int main(){
    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while(t--){
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        if((n+1)%3==0 || (n-1)%3 == 0){
            cout << "First" << endl;
        }else{
            cout << "Second" << endl;
        }
    }
return 0;
}
